COMP 523 Manager
----------------
Structure for app and this readme was adapted from [Hackathon Starter] (https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject

# Install and run MongoDB
Varies based on OS

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

FAQ
---

### Why do I get `403 Error: Forbidden` when submitting a form?
You need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been
added in the [pull request #40](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/40)
as part of the CSRF protection.

```
input(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=_csrf)
```

### I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?
That's a custom error message defined in `app.js` to indicate that there was a
problem connecting to MongoDB:

```js
mongoose.connection.on('error', () => {
  console.error('MongoDB Connection Error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.');
});
```
You need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `app.js`. You can
download MongoDB [here](http://mongodb.org/downloads), or install it via a package manager.

Windows users, read [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).

How It Works (mini guides)
--------------------------

### How do I create a new page?
A more correct way to be to say "How do I create a new route". The main file `app.js` contains all the routes.
Each route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see 3 or more arguments
to routes. In cases like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments
are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from
continuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.

```js
app.get('/account', passportConfig.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);
```

It always goes from left to right. A user visits `/account` page. Then `isAuthenticated` middleware
checks if you are authenticated:

```js
exports.isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
};
```

If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your "door" by calling `return next();`. It then proceeds to the
next middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on `GET` requests or redirects on `POST` requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to *Account Management* page, otherwise you will be redirected to *Login* page.

```js
exports.getAccount = (req, res) => {
  res.render('account/profile', {
    title: 'Account Management'
  });
};
```

Express.js has `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.delete`, but for the most part you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.
If you just want to display a page, then use `GET`, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use `POST`.

Here is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building
a page that lists all books from database.

**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.
```js
app.get('/books', bookController.getBooks);
```

---

**Note:** As of Express 4.x you can define you routes like so:

```js
app.route('/books')
  .get(bookController.getBooks)
  .post(bookController.createBooks)
  .put(bookController.updateBooks)
  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)
```

And here is how a route would look if it required an *authentication* and an *authorization* middleware:

```js
app.route('/api/twitter')
  .all(passportConfig.isAuthenticated)
  .all(passportConfig.isAuthorized)
  .get(apiController.getTwitter)
  .post(apiController.postTwitter)
```

Use whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I really think that chaining HTTP verbs on
`app.route` is very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand I can no longer see all my routes at a glance
when you have one route per line.

**Step 2.** Create a new schema and a model `Book.js` inside the *models* directory.
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
});

const Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
module.exports = Book;
```

**Step 3.** Create a new controller file called `book.js` inside the *controllers* directory.
```js
/**
 * GET /books
 * List all books.
 */
const Book = require('../models/Book.js');

exports.getBooks = (req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
};
```

**Step 4.** Import that controller in `app.js`.
```js
const bookController = require('./controllers/book');
```

**Step 5.** Create `books.pug` template.
```jade
extends layout

block content
  .page-header
    h3 All Books

  ul
    for book in books
      li= book.name
```

That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:

```js
app.get('/books',(req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
});
```

Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in `app.js` it becomes a little difficult to navigate the file.
I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could
work with your teammates without running into *MERGE CONFLICTS*. Imagine you have 4 developers
working on a single `app.js`, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.
If you are the only developer then it's fine. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes
difficult to maintain everything in a single file.

That's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.
Most of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:
[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets,
sending emails via [Nodemailer](http://nodemailer.com/), form validation using [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) library,
parsing websites using [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), and etc.

Cheatsheets
-----------

#### Arrow Functions

Arrow function expression. Shorter syntax & lexically binds the `this` value. Arrow functions are anonymous.

```js
singleParam => { statements }
```
```js
() => { statements }
```
```js
(param1, param2) => expression
```
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = arr.map(x => x * x);
```

###Mongoose Cheatsheet

#### Find all users:
```js
User.find((err, users) => {
  console.log(users);
});
```

#### Find a user by email:
```js
let userEmail = 'example@gmail.com';
User.findOne({ email: userEmail }, (err, user) => {
  console.log(user);
});
```

#### Find 5 most recent user accounts:
```js
User
  .find()
  .sort({ _id: -1 })
  .limit(5)
  .exec((err, users) => {
    console.log(users);
  });
```

#### Get total count of a field from all documents:
Let's suppose that each user has a `votes` field and you would like to count
the total number of votes in your database across all users. One very
inefficient way would be to loop through each document and manually accumulate
the count. Or you could use [MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-introduction/) instead:

```js
User.aggregate({ $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: '$votes' } } }, (err, votesCount)  => {
  console.log(votesCount.total);
});
```
